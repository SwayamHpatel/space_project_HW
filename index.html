  <br>
  There are artificial sattelites sorrounding Earth. Each sattelites have a different role to play.
  there are sattelites which provide images of climate, clouds, oceans, lands and ice They also 
  measure gases in the atmosphere, such as ozone and carbon dioxide, and the amount of energy 
  that Earth absorbs and emits.</h4>

A low earth orbit (LEO) satellite is an object,
 generally a piece of electronic equipment,

<h2>Space</h2>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Nebula</h2>
<div class="line"></div>
<br>
<h4>There are many types of nebula but I will be talking about stellar nebula 
  and planetary nebula. Steller nebula is made up of  dust , plasma,hydrogen
  and helium gas but on the other hand a planetary nebula is a nebula which is 
  made up of gas and plasma but that form near a ageing star. There are more than 5000+ 
  nebulas in the whole cosmos. The first nebula which was discovered is the M27 which 
  was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764. </h4>

  <br>
<br>
<h2>Black Holes</h2>
<div class="line"></div>
<h4>Black Holes were formed after the big bang but there are few more
   ways a black hole forms ,firstly when a massive star collapses from 
   the centre it can create a new black hole but that can also create a 
   supernova or a exploding star and the second way is the merger process
    when two neutron stars orbiting closely together due to gravitational
     waves and slowly merges with each other can make a black hole but it can also create a super neutron star. 
  The nearest black hole is the Gaia BH1 which is just 1,600 light years 
  far and 10 times bigger than the Sun.  </h4>

  <h2>Constellations</h2>
<div class="line"></div>
<h4>Constellations is a group of stars which creates an image. It has names according to the images few of the constellations are Orion , 
  it is one of the recognizable constellations and the meaning of the name is hunter.
   The next is the Ursa Major. 
   Ursa major is a big bear.
    The word Ursa means a bear and this is the constellation near the poles star also known as polaris.
     There is one more which is the Ursa Minor. 
  It is the same but Ursa minor is a small bear image.  </h4>

  <h2>Clusters</h2>
<div class="line"></div>
<h4> Clusters are a very interesting thing in space. 
  A cluster is a group of stars together. 
  There are almost a hundred stars in a cluster.
  Now I will tell you how many types of clusters there are.
  There are mainly two types of clusters one is the globular cluster second is the open cluster.
   Globular clusters have more than a thousand stars. 
   They are very much compact and close to each other and are aged stars but on the other hand open clusters have less than hundred stars and are very spreaded and are young stars. 
   The most famous open cluster is the Pleiades and the most famous globular cluster is the M13.   </h4>

   <h2>Galaxies</h2>
<div class="line"></div>
<h4>  galaxies like the types of galaxies,there are mainly four types of galaxies:
   Elliptical , Spiral Irregular and Peculiar.
    Elliptical galaxies are divided into shapes and are named E0,E3,E5,E7,S0 etc this
     is the same with spiral galaxies but their shapes and names are different like Sa,Sb,Sc,SBa,SBb,SBc etc
      irregular and peculiar has no such shapes their shapes are different every time and that is why they have not been named as the spiral and elliptical. 
      Scientists also know that a galaxy has dust,stars,many types of gases,dark matter,nebulas,black holes,neutron stars etc.   </h4>
